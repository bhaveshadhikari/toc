# Theory of Computation Programs Overview
---

This repository contains programs written in C to solve various problems. Below is a brief overview of each program:

## 1. Prefixes, Suffixes, and Substrings

File: `1.prefix.c`

This program finds all prefixes, suffixes, and substrings of the word "COMPUTATION".

## 2. DFA for Even Numbers of 0s and 1s

File: `2.dfa.c`

This program simulates a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts strings containing an even number of 0s and 1s.

## 3. Validating C Identifiers and Keywords

File: `3.validate.c`

This program validates C identifiers and identifies keywords in the provided string.

## 4. PDA for \( a^n b^n \)

File: `4.pda.c`

This program implements a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) that accepts strings of the form \( a^n b^n \).

## 5. Turing Machine Simulation

File: `5.tm.c`

This program simulates a Turing Machine for equal number of 0s followed by equal number of 1s.

Each program is contained in a separate C file within the repository. You can find detailed comments within each file explaining the implementation.
